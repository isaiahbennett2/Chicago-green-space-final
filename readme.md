# Reproduction of Urban Environmental Justice of Green Space Access in Chicago

## Abstract

This study is a *reproduction* of:

The lab called "Urban Environmental Justice of Green Space Access in Chicago" from Middlebury College's Human Geography with GIS class. 

The abstract of the original study is as follows: 

Green space provide numerous public health, social, and environmental benefits to cities and their residents. These include
mitigation of urban heat, improved storm water management and water quality, improved air quality, expanded access to
exercise, and the social-psychological benefits of enjoying nature.

In this lab, we will conduct a GIS study similar to Wolch, Wilson and Fehrenbach's (2005) research on access to green
spaces in Los Angeles, California. Wolch et al's purpose was to assess the environmental justice implications of municipal
green spaces and recreation funding policies (Proposition K), asking whether minority groups, and especially minority
children, were disproportionately excluded from access to green spaces. They operationalized the concept of "access" in
terms of both the proximity and the total area of green spaces, and found significant disparities between racial/ethnic
groups, rooted in histories of bias and segregation.

Our purpose is to assess people's access to green space (parks and forests) in segregated neighborhoods of Chicago. To do
so, we will estimate indicators of access to green space according to regions where Asian, Black, Latinx, or White
ethnic/racial groups are the majority (60% of the population or more), and Mixed neighborhoods where no single group
makes up 60% or more of the population. The indicators of green space access are:

• Percentage of people living within 0.25 miles of a green space

• Green space area per person (in square meters)
